# A Refined Venn Diagram of Data Science

Earlier attempts to define data science visually—such as Conway’s Venn diagram—centered on hacking skills, statistics, and domain knowledge. While influential, that framing is now outdated.

A more precise picture situates data science at the intersection of:  
- **Statistical modeling** — tools for inference, uncertainty, and causality  
- **Scientific computing** — numerical methods, simulations, and computation  
- **Systems research** — studying complex, interactive software environments

This triad places data science alongside fields like econometrics, computational physics, and quantitative social science. It emphasizes rigor and replicability. And it highlights that data science is not just about *using* data, but about *understanding the systems* that produce it.
