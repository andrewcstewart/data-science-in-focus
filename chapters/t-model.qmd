# The T-Model of Skill Development

Data scientists develop along a T-shaped trajectory:  
- The **horizontal bar** represents breadth—exposure to tools, methods, and adjacent domains.  
- The **vertical bar** represents depth—specialization in one or more areas like causal inference, simulation, or optimization.

This model supports differentiated roles:  
- A generalist might help design broad research programs.  
- A specialist might focus on methodological innovation or platform-level modeling.

Title tracks should reflect this diversity. Rather than forcing all scientists into a “full-stack” mold, orgs can recognize distinct paths:  
- Researcher  
- Methodologist  
- Domain expert  
- Tool-builder

This structure also helps build effective teams—ones that combine varied skill sets across the disciplinary landscape.
