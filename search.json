    "text": "Refining Practice, Deepening Understanding\nData Science In Focus is a reflective essay series on data science as a scientific discipline—what it is, how it’s practiced, and what it has become. As the field matures beyond its early hype cycles and into a coherent form of applied research, this series aims to sharpen our collective understanding of the work itself.\nWhere a bountiful collection of earlier works have laid the groundwork for a newly forming field, these essays here revisit core questions with the benefit of hindsight:\n- What does it mean to practice data science as science?\n- How should teams, tools, and systems support inquiry over output?\n- What kind of knowledge does data science produce—and for whom?\nRooted in the scientific method, structured around the research lifecycle, and steeped in the evolving norms of modern tech orgs, this series puts the discipline itself into focus.",

    "text": "What Is Data Science?\nIn the era of tech monoculture, the term data science has been stretched to near incoherence—absorbing everything from analytics engineering to AI research under its inflated halo. But if we strip away the branding and job title inflation, what remains is something much older, much simpler, and much more principled: data science is the application of the scientific method to the study of data-generating systems.\nIt is not a subfield of software engineering. It is not a synonym for machine learning. It is not a placeholder for “person who works with data.” Data science, properly understood, is a scientific discipline—defined not by its tooling or domain, but by its epistemology. Its goal is to generate knowledge. Its process is experimental. Its currency is uncertainty. And its outputs are not products, but explanations.",

    "text": "A Discipline of Inquiry, Not Output\nWhat distinguishes data science from engineering is not the data—it’s the orientation toward inquiry.\n\nEngineers build systems that are designed to perform reliably and at scale.\nScientists study systems to understand how and why they behave the way they do.\n\nData scientists may use engineering tools, work within engineering organizations, and produce artifacts that feed into engineering systems. But their foundational job is to ask—and answer—questions about system behavior. They design experiments, test hypotheses, analyze variation, and build explanatory models. In this sense, a data scientist is closer to a physicist studying turbulence than a developer deploying a feature.\nThis isn’t a hierarchy. It’s a division of labor—and misunderstanding it leads to broken workflows, misaligned expectations, and org charts that burn out good scientists by asking them to write production code full-time.",

Some examples:\n\nHow does user engagement change in response to a new design?\nWhat latent behaviors drive churn in a subscription model?\nWhy did model performance degrade last week?\nWhat features of a marketplace system produce price instability?\n\nThese are not engineering problems.

Tools enable the work—they aren’t the work.\nIn fact, many of the tools used in data science are borrowed from engineering or software development. The difference is in how they’re used. A data scientist doesn’t write Python to deploy services; they use it to simulate a hypothesis, analyze system output, or validate statistical assumptions. SQL isn’t a pipeline—it’s a telescope.",

    "text": "Science Inside a Software Org\nOne of the greatest challenges facing data scientists today is that they are often the only scientists inside engineering organizations. That creates cultural friction. Deadlines prioritize shipping over understanding. Metrics are flattened into KPIs. Curiosity becomes a liability. Documentation is seen as overhead rather than intellectual scaffolding.\nBut despite these tensions, data science has a crucial role to play: it helps organizations understand themselves. It maps the terrain, exposes the mechanisms, and builds the mental models that engineering and product teams rely on to make informed decisions.\nWhen practiced as science, data science becomes the epistemic engine of a tech company.

    "text": "Data science didn’t emerge from a single lineage—it was born from a convergence. Statistics, scientific computing, database management, and machine learning all played formative roles in shaping the field. During the early 2000s, as computational infrastructure and open-source tools proliferated, organizations began to realize that “data” wasn’t just a byproduct of digital systems—it was a source of insight.\nThe rise of the “data scientist” as a role came partly from pragmatism: organizations needed generalists who could both analyze and code. But this era was also defined by confusion. Data science became a catch-all title encompassing analysts, engineers, ML researchers, and more. The result was a temporary inflation of the field—a golden age of generalists with ambiguous scope.\nNow, a decade later, the landscape is maturing. Specialized engineering roles have splintered off. Machine learning engineering, analytics engineering, and decision science have defined clearer scopes. What remains in the heart of “data science” is its original essence: a scientific discipline grounded in inquiry, system behavior, and the pursuit of explanatory knowledge.",

Its core deliverable is understanding, not execution.\nThe organizational structure of data science varies:\n- Centralized teams emphasize consistency and shared standards.\n- Embedded models prioritize domain intimacy and responsiveness.\n- Hybrid approaches attempt to balance autonomy and alignment.\nTensions often arise when data science is treated as a service function, expected to deliver dashboards or one-off analyses on demand. But a scientific function thrives on longer-term research questions, context-rich collaboration, and space to explore uncertainty. Successful teams recognize this and give data scientists both embedded partnerships and protected research capacity.\nThe most effective data science orgs invest in career ladders, program-based workstreams, and a clear cultural distinction between scientists and engineers—while encouraging tight collaboration across them.",
